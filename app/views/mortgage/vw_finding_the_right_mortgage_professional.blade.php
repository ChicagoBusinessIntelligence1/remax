			<h1>Finding the Right Mortgage Professional</h1>
			<hr/>
			<p>A RE/MAX agent can help you find a solid lender or broker. You might also ask friends, family members and colleagues for references.</p>
			<div class="panel">
				<h5>When interviewing lenders and mortgage brokers, consider asking the following questions:</h5>
				<ul class="bullet ulWorkWith">
					<li>What fees are involved?</li>
					<li>What types of mortgages might I qualify for?</li>
					<li>What interest rates are available for different types of mortgages?</li>
					<li>Can I lock in an interest rate? Will it cost me anything to do that?</li>
					<li>What are the closing costs? Can I wrap these costs into the mortgage?</li>
					<li>How much cash will I have to bring to closing?</li>
					<li>How long will it take to process my loan?</li>
					<li>Are there special programs I might be eligible for?</li>
					<li>Can I get references of customers you've worked with in the last two years?</li>
					<li>How many lenders do you work with? (For mortgage brokers only.)</li>
					<li>How are you paid? How do you make money on my loan? (For mortgage brokers only.)</li>

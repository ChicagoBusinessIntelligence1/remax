			<h1>Renovating a home? Consider a 203(k) loan</h1>
			<hr/>
			<p>The 203(k) program, available through HUD, provides benefits for buyers of homes in need of major renovation and repair. If you're looking for a fixer-upper, the 203(k) program enables you to obtain just one mortgage to finance both the purchase and rehabilitation of the property.</p>
			<p>Not all home loans come with the option of paying points. If this option is available, it's worth investigating, as it could save you money in the long run.</p>
			<p>When does it make sense to pay points on a mortgage? Although it greatly depends on your situation, paying points can make sense when you have cash on hand, plan to stay in your home for a while, and don't intend to refinance in the near-term</p>
			<p>To figure out whether points will equal savings for you, simply divide the total you paid for your points by your monthly savings. This gives you the number of months it will take for you to recoup the money you paid for the points.</p>
			<div class="panel">
				<p>Example: Let's say that paying $5,000 in points up front saves you $85 per month. That means it would take 59 months for your points to really start saving you money. That's almost five years.</p>

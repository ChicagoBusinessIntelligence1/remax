			<h1>The Benefits of Home Ownership</h1>
			<hr/>
				<p>Plain and simple, owning a home can improve your quality of life, provide stability and give you a sense of control you just can't get from renting. You have a place to live when you rent, but buying is something much deeper – and better.</p>
			<ul class="no-bullet">
			<h5>The intangibles are tough to measure, but there are other benefits you can quantify: </h5>	
				<li>
					<h5 class="subheader">Financial investment:</h5>
					<p>Your monthly mortgage payment creates equity for you, not your landlord.</p>
				</li>

				<li>
					<h5 class="subheader">The interest on your mortgage is a tax deduction:</h5>
					<p>While this isn't a reason in itself to buy a home, it's nice to get a break at tax time.</p>
				</li>

				<li>
					<h5 class="subheader">Fixed monthly housing payment:</h5>
					<p>If you opt for a fixed-rate mortgage, the monthly rate of your mortgage won't change for the length of the term.</p>
				</li>

				<li>
					<h5 class="subheader">Tax-free gain:</h5>
					<p>When it's time to sell your home, you don’t pay taxes on the proceeds of the sale that are above what you paid (with some restrictions – see information on capital gains).</p>
				</li>

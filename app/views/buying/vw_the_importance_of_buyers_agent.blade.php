			<h1>The Importance of a Buyer's Agent</h1>
			<hr/>
				<p>A real estate transaction is a complex process involving stacks of paperwork and a number of outside service providers and contractors.</p>
				<p>An experienced buyer's agent can guide you through the process, answering your questions and serving as your advocate (see the Anatomy of a Home Purchase). Your agent will help you find the property that fits your needs, submit offers and counteroffers, suggest a good property inspector and other professionals, and provide all sorts of relevant advice.</p>
				<p>With a buyer's agent, you'll have someone on your side, looking out for your interests every step of the way.</p>
			<h5>What are the costs involved in hiring a buyer’s agent?</h5>	
			<p>As a buyer, you don’t pay your agent directly. Instead, the agent receives an agreed-upon portion of the listing agent's sales commission (usually about half), which is paid by the seller.</p>
			<p>If you're thinking this structure works against you by giving your buyer's agent an incentive to let you pay more than you need to, consider this:</p>
			<p>The increase in a buyer's agent commission on, say, a $5,000 to $10,000 jump in price would be only $125 to $250. Good buyer's agents – those who are productive and engaged in the business full time – aren't going to risk their reputations. Your satisfaction – which can generate referrals to your friends and family – is the lifeblood of their careers.</p>

			<h1>How an Agent Markets Your Home</h1>
			<hr/>
			<p>Experienced agents understand how to accurately price your home and make it stand out in the market. They also have access to a vast referral network, enabling them to connect with potential buyers across town or around the world.</p>
			<p>Here are a few avenues RE/MAX agents may use to market your home, both online and off.</p>

			<dl>
				<dt>Multiple photos: </dt>
				<dd>Studies show that buyers are more likely to visit a home that includes multiple photos of the listing. Well-lit, wide-angled photos highlight your home's best features and important rooms.</dd>

				<dt>Designated website:</dt>
				<dd>A customized website for your home is an effective online marketing strategy. It can showcase your home with photos, virtual tours or videos, and details about the property and surrounding neighborhood.</dd>

				<dt>Virtual tours: </dt>
				<dd>Video tours can be posted with or without a designated property website. Giving buyers an inside look at your property online can get them interested enough to schedule a showing.</dd>

				<dt>Home search websites:</dt>
				<dd>More than 75 percent of buyers start their home search online. Itâ€™s important that your listing receives full exposure in the MLS and in search engine results. Posting your listing on Craigslist, Facebook, newspaper websites and elsewhere can also be effective in reaching potential buyers.</dd>

				<dt>remax.com: </dt>
				<dd>All RE/MAX listings (as well as listings from other companies) appear on remax.com, where millions of buyers browse for homes and see listings with multiple photos, property descriptions and other details. /dd>

				<dt>Design Center:</dt>
				<dd>RE/MAX agents have access to a proprietary design center that enables them to create professional marketing materials of your home for print and/or online exposure.</dd>

				<dt>The RE/MAX network: </dt>
				<dd>Another advantage of choosing RE/MAX is direct access to a network of nearly 90,000 RE/MAX agents around the world, many of them working with motivated buyers.</dd>

				<dt>The RE/MAX yard sign:</dt>
				<dd> The RE/MAX Balloon is among the most recognized logos across all industries, not just real estate. A RE/MAX yard sign in front of your house makes an immediate, positive connection with potential buyers who already know the brand.</dd>

				<p>Your RE/MAX agent likely has other techniques that will attract qualified buyers in your specific market.</p>
